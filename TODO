- make install: create some default data path

- integrate smack access control in get_value and set_value functions
  of bt-daemon (main.c)

- test multi-part messaging in the client-side of the library, mirroring
  changes made to bt-daemon's protocol handling

- add checks for data consistency, and determine if gdbm needs to be
  "reorganised" to ensure minimal I/O bottlenecking

- finish completion of Buxton's public library
  - rename to "libbuxton"
  - rename existing buxton library

- Split up existing buxton library into convenience libraries to link
  against (static archives)

- Provide demonstration (in demo/) to make use of new client library
