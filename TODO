- make install: create some default data path

- integrate smack access control in get_value and set_value functions
  of bt-daemon (main.c)

  changes made to bt-daemon's protocol handling

- add checks for data consistency, and determine if gdbm needs to be
  "reorganised" to ensure minimal I/O bottlenecking
